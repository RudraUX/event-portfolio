                Hi! I’m Izza, 28 years old this year and I’m the founder of
                Serba Serbi. I’ve always been passionate about fashion, music (
                I love the violin) designing spaces and being a part of the
                creative community. My love for vintage items, music and the
                whole aesthetic has always been a part of me since young and it
                definitely bloomed during covid when I had plenty of time to
                myself. I hosted my first event in 7&8th March, from there on I
                was able to connect with other creatives who had similar goals
                and now I find myself in a beautiful supportive community
                including my Serba Serbi Team which I’m extremely grateful for!
                I’m also a proud mother to my beautiful daughter Mawar, she
                keeps me going in life and inspires me to stay curious, always,
                and also my loving husband!

                Serba Serbi is a vintage & retro-inspired bazaar for those who
                enjoy stylish things. Featuring pre-loved clothing, music,
                coffee, food and more, Serba Serbi began as a curated yard sale
                in Kajang, Selangor which quickly grew into a celebration for
                young people to discover and define their own personal style.
                Event pop-ups happen around different states in malaysia - KL,
                Penang, Johor etc.
